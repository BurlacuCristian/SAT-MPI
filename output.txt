=== Detailed DP Example ===
Formula: (¬x2 ∨ x1) ∧ (x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (¬x3 ∨ ¬x1)
Eliminate variable x1
 Current CNF: (¬x2 ∨ x1) ∧ (x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (¬x3 ∨ ¬x1)
  Resolvent of {1, -2} & {-3, -1}: {-3, -2}
  Eliminate variable x2
   Current CNF: (x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (¬x3 ∨ ¬x2)
    Resolvent of {2, 3} & {-3, -2}: {3, -3}
    Eliminate variable x3
     Current CNF: (¬x3 ∨ x3)
      Resolvent of {3, -3} & {3, -3}: set()
      Found empty clause — CNF is UNSAT.
Result: UNSAT

=== Detailed DPLL Example ===
Formula: (¬x2 ∨ x1) ∧ (x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (¬x3 ∨ ¬x1)
Initial CNF: (¬x2 ∨ x1) ∧ (x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (¬x3 ∨ ¬x1)
Branch on x1 = True/False
Try x1=T
  Unit propagate x3=F
  Unit propagate x2=T
  All clauses satisfied — CNF is SAT.
Result: SAT
